# COMP249 & COMP248 Course Projects

This repository hosts projects and assignments related to Concordia University's courses COMP249 (Object-Oriented Programming II) and COMP248 (Object-Oriented Programming I). These courses cover the fundamentals of programming and object-oriented design using Java, aiming to equip students with the skills necessary for software development and problem-solving.

## About the Courses

- **COMP248**: Focuses on the introduction to programming, control structures, objects, classes, methods, and arrays.
- **COMP249**: Builds upon COMP248, diving deeper into object-oriented programming, data structures, and more complex problem-solving techniques.

## Projects Overview

The projects within this repository are designed to reflect the learning outcomes of both courses, challenging students to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems. Examples include:

- Basic console applications
- GUI-based applications
- Data manipulation and storage
- Simple game development

## Technologies

- **Language**: Java
- **Development Environment**: Any IDE that supports Java, with examples primarily using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/).

## Setup

To run these projects, ensure you have Java and an IDE installed. Clone the repository, import the projects into your IDE, and execute them as Java applications.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/COMP248-249-Projects.git
